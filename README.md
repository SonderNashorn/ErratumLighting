# ErratumLighting
The Lighting manager for Erratum level 2

The lighting Activator manages the lights in set rooms and their behaviour once puzzles were done for our game. 
It loads all lights tagged as "Deterring light" and sets their light to a set value.
We had one switch for each room and with the same call I've made it so if the light is on it will turn it off if it is off nothing happens anyways.
